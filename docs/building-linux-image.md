# Building a Linux Virtual Machine Image with Elemental

This section provides an overview of how you build a Linux image that can include additional extensions using Elemental and the `elemental3ctl` command-line interface. The image can be used to boot a virtual machine and run a Linux operating system, such as `openSUSE Tumbleweed`, with custom configurations and extensions.

## Prerequisites

* A server or virtual machine running Tumbleweed, Leap 16.0, SLES 16 or SUSE Linux Micro 6.2, with a minimum x86_64-v2 instruction set.

## Prepare the installation target

1. Create a `qcow2` disk with a size of `20GB`:

    ```shell
    qemu-img create -f qcow2 example.qcow2 20G
    ```

2. Associate the created virtual disk with a block device:

    ```shell
    sudo modprobe nbd && sudo qemu-nbd -c /dev/nbd0 example.qcow2
    ```

3. Check for the block device:

    ```shell
    sudo lsblk /dev/nbd0
    ```

## Prepare basic configuration

`elemental3ctl` can apply basic configuration and extensions at deployment time in the following ways:

* Through a [system extension image](#configuring-through-a-system-extension-image)
* Through a [configuration script](#configuring-through-a-configuration-script)

### Configuring through a system extension image

While we recommend reading through the complete document to understand system extensions in the context of elemental 
project, please refer to the
["Create system extension images"](./systemd-system-extensions.md#create-system-extension-images) section for specific
steps. After that continue further with the
["Configuring through a configuration script"](#configuring-through-a-configuration-script) section below.

### Preparing the system extension image as an overlay

Overlay is the way of merging contents of a system extension onto the host system such that it all looks like a part
of the host system.

1. On the same level as `example-extension/`, create an `overlays/var/lib/extensions` directory:
    ```shell
    mkdir -p overlays/var/lib/extensions
    ```

1. Based on the section you follow above, copy either the `kubectl.x86-64.raw` or the `tools-1.0_1.0_x86-64.raw` file
   to this directory.
1. Create an archive from the overlay directory:
    ```shell
    tar -cavzf overlays.tar.gz -C overlays .
    ```

You have now prepared an archive containing a system extension image for use during the installation process. This
adds the `kubectl` binary or `strace` package to the operating system after boot.


### Configuring through a configuration script

The OS installation supports configurations through a script that will run in a `chroot` on the unpacked operating system after expanding the provided overlays archives.

#### Example configuration script

This configuration script applies the following set of configurations on the built image:

1. Configures the password for the `root` user to `linux`.
2. Sets up a `oneshot` type `systemd.service` that will list the contents of the `/var/lib/extensions/` directory.

*Steps:*

1. Create configuration script:

    ```shell
    cat <<- EOF > config.sh
    #!/bin/bash

    set -e

    # Set root user password
    echo "linux" | passwd root --stdin

    # Configure example systemd service
    cat <<- END > /etc/systemd/system/example-oneshot.service
    [Unit]
    Description=Example One-Shot Service

    [Service]
    Type=oneshot
    ExecStart=/bin/ls -alh /var/lib/extensions/

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    END

    systemctl enable example-oneshot.service
    EOF
    ```

2. Make `config.sh` executable:

    ```shell
    chmod +x config.sh
    ```

## Install operating system on a target device

Once you run the below command, the virtual disk created as part of the [Prepare the Installation Target](#prepare-the-installation-target) section now holds a ready to boot image that will run `openSUSE Tumbleweed` and will be configured as described in the [Prepare Basic Configuration](#prepare-basic-configuration) section.

```shell
sudo elemental3ctl install \
  --overlay tar://overlays.tar.gz \
  --config config.sh \
  --os-image registry.opensuse.org/devel/unifiedcore/tumbleweed/containers/uc-base-os-kernel-default:latest \
  --target /dev/nbd0 \
  --cmdline "root=LABEL=SYSTEM console=ttyS0"
```

Note that:

* The `overlays.tar.gz` tarball came from the system extension image [example configuration](#example-system-extension-image).
* The `config.sh` script came from the [configuration script example](#example-configuration-script).
* `/dev/nbd0` is the chosen block device from the `qemu-nbd -c` command in the [Prepare the Installation Target](#prepare-the-installation-target) section.

> **NOTE:** `elemental3ctl` also supports a `--local` flag that can be used in combination with the `DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/podman/podman.sock` environment variable to allow for referring to locally pulled OS images.

In case you encounter issues with the process, make sure to enable the `--debug` flag for more information. If the issue persists and you are not aware of the problem, feel free to raise a GitHub Issue.

## Mandatory cleanup before booting the image

Since you attached a block device to the virtual disk created in the [Prepare the Installation Target](#prepare-the-installation-target) section, detach the block device before booting the image:

```shell
sudo qemu-nbd -d /dev/nbd0
```

## Starting the virtual machine image

To boot the image in a virtual machine, you can use either QEMU or libvirt utilities for creating the VM.

*Using QEMU:*
> **NOTE:** Make sure you have `qemu` installed on your system. If not, you can install it using `zypper install qemu-x86`.

> **NOTE:** If you are using a different architecture, make sure to adjust the `qemu-system-x86_64` command accordingly.

> **NOTE:** If you haven't configured your user to be in the `kvm` group, you can run the command with `sudo` to allow QEMU to access the KVM acceleration.

```shell
qemu-system-x86_64 -m 8G \
         -accel kvm \
         -cpu host \
         -hda example.qcow2 \
         -bios /usr/share/qemu/ovmf-x86_64.bin \
         -nographic
```

You should see the bootloader prompting you to start `openSUSE Tumbleweed`.


### Explore virtual machine

1. Login with the root user and password as configured in the [config.sh](#example-configuration-script) script.

2. Check you are running the expected operating system:

    ```shell
    cat /etc/os-release
    ```

3. Check that `example-oneshot.service` has run successfully:

    * View service status:

        ```shell
        systemctl status example-oneshot.service
        ```

    * View service logs:

        ```shell
        journalctl -u example-oneshot.service
        ```

4. Check that `elemental3ctl` binary is available and working:

    * Check logs for the `systemd-sysext.service`:

        ```shell
        journalctl -u systemd-sysext.service
        ```

    * Try calling the command:

        ```shell
        elemental3ctl version
        ```

## Create an Installer Media

Elemental supports creating installation media in the form of live ISOs or RAW disk images. Content-wise they both are almost the same. The difference is that ISO installs to a target disk device and the RAW disk resets to factory from a recovery partition.

The ISO image includes EFI binaries and bootloader setup, the OS image (as a squashfs image) and the installation assets (configuration script and drop-in files overlayed over the OS).

The RAW image includes the ESP partition with the EFI binaries, the bootloader setup and a recovery partition including the OS image (again as an squashfs image) together with the installation assets.

Regardless of whether the artifact is an ISO or a RAW disk, the respective image boots like a live OS system based on tmpfs overlayfs. The boot process relies on the `dmsquash-live` dracut module for live booting.

To create a self installer image, you should prepare and include a specific set of configuration assets. These include:

1. A configuration script
2. Extensions to the installer media


### Configure the Live Installer

The installer media supports configurations through a script which will run in late initramfs in a writeable system root.

There are some of relevant kernel parameters used by the installer to define the boot context. Those are not configurable
and included by `elemental3ctl` when setting the bootloader.

* `elm.recovery`: this flag is used to identify the current system is booting from a recovery partition.
* `elm.reset`: this flag is used to identify the system is booting from installer RAW image requiring a reset to be fully installed.

These kernel parameters can be easily used to handle automated actions at boot like in the example below.

#### Example live configuration script

In this example, you prepare a configuration script that sets four aspects:

* Autologin so the live ISO does not require a root password
* An elemental-autoinstaller service to run the installation at boot
* An elemental-reset service to run the reset at boot
* A link between the extensions in the ISO filesystem and `/run/extensions` so that they are loaded at boot

Create the script and make it executable:

```shell
cat <<- END > config-live.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Set autologin for the Live ISO
mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/serial-getty@ttyS0.service.d

cat > /etc/systemd/system/serial-getty@ttyS0.service.d/override.conf << EOF
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty --autologin root --noclear %I $TERM
EOF

mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/getty@tty1.service.d

cat > /etc/systemd/system/getty@tty1.service.d/override.conf << EOF
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty --autologin root --noclear %I $TERM
EOF

# Ensure extensions included in ISO's /extensions folder are loaded at boot
# ISO filesystem is mounted at /run/initramfs/live folder
rm -rf /run/extensions
ln -s /run/initramfs/live/extensions /run/extensions

# Set the elemental-autoinstall.service
cat > /etc/systemd/system/elemental-autoinstall.service << EOF

systemctl enable elemental-reset.service
END

chmod +x config-live.sh
```

#### Include Extensions in the Installer Media

The provided OS does not include the `elemental3ctl` required to run the installation to the target disk. The `elemental3ctl` is delivered through a systemd extension image.
To ensure it is available at ISO boot, it has to be included in the ISO filesystem and either copied or linked to `/run/extensions`.

This example shows how to prepare the ISO overlay directory tree and the configuration script to ensure the `elemental3ctl` extensions are
available and loaded at boot.

1. Create an `iso-overlay/extensions` directory:

    ```shell
    mkdir -p iso-overlay/extensions
    ```

2. Create the [elemental3ctl](#example-system-extension-image) extension image and move it to this directory:

    ```shell
    mv example-extension/mkosi.output/elemental3ctl-3.0.x86-64.raw iso-overlay/extensions
    ```

3. Make sure the live configuration script links the `extensions` folder at `/run/extensions`


### Build the Installer Image

If you do not have `mcopy` command on your system, install it using:
```shell
zypper in mtools
```

The command below creates an ISO image inside the `build` output directory.
It will be using an `openSUSE Tumbleweed` image and will be configured to automatically self install to the target device (e.g. `dev/sda`) at boot.

```shell
sudo elemental3ctl --debug build-installer \
    --type iso \
    --output build \
    --os-image registry.opensuse.org/devel/unifiedcore/tumbleweed/containers/uc-base-os-kernel-default:latest \
    --overlay dir://iso-overlay \
    --cmdline "console=ttyS0" \
    --config config-live.sh \
    --install-target /dev/sda \
    --install-overlay tar://overlays.tar.gz \
    --install-config config.sh \
    --install-cmdline "console=ttyS0"
```

In order to build a RAW disk image just use the same command as a above but switching to RAW type (`--type raw` flag).

The RAW disk image only includes the ESP partition and a recovery partition. The recovery partition includes a
squashfs OS image to boot from like a live ISO would.

Note that:
* The `overlays.tar.gz` tarball came from the system extension image [example configuration](#example-system-extension-image).
* The `config.sh` script came from the [configuration script example](#example-configuration-script).
* The `/dev/sda` is the target device you want the ISO to install to.
* The `iso-overlay` is the directory tree [including extensions](#include-extensions-in-the-installer-media) that will be included in the ISO filesystem of the built image.
* The `config-live.sh` script came from the live [configuration script example](#example-live-configuration-script).


### Booting an ISO Installer Image

> **NOTE:** Make sure you have `qemu` installed on your system. If not, you can install it using `zypper -n install qemu-x86`.
> If you are using a different architecture, ensure the package name and respective command below are adjusted accordingly.

Launch a virtual machine to boot the installer ISO and verify the automated installation:

```shell
cp /usr/share/qemu/ovmf-x86_64-vars.bin .
qemu-system-x86_64 -m 8G \
         -accel kvm \
         -cpu host \
         -hda disk.img \
         -cdrom build/installer.iso \
         -drive if=pflash,format=raw,readonly,file=/usr/share/qemu/ovmf-x86_64-code.bin \
         -drive if=pflash,format=raw,file=ovmf-x86_64-vars.bin \
         -nographic
```

Note that:
* EFI devices are included in the command. There is a code device for the EFI firmware and a local copy of the EFI variable store to persist any new EFI entry included during the installation.
* The `disk.img` can be an empty disk image file created with the `qemu-img create` command.


### Booting a RAW Installer Image

> **NOTE:** Make sure you have `qemu` installed on your system. If not, you can install it using `zypper -n install qemu-x86`.
> If you are using a different architecture, ensure the package name and respective command below are adjusted accordingly.

To test the RAW installer image with QEMU, you need to either dump the image to a bigger image or expand the
generated image.

```shell
cp /usr/share/qemu/ovmf-x86_64-vars.bin .
qemu-img resize build/installer.raw 16G
```

Launch a virtual machine to boot the installer RAW and verify, at boot, it self expands the partition table
to fulfill the disk geometry and creates additional partitions.

```shell
qemu-system-x86_64 -m 8G \
         -accel kvm \
         -cpu host \
         -hda build/installer.raw \
         -drive if=pflash,format=raw,readonly,file=/usr/share/qemu/ovmf-x86_64-code.bin \
         -drive if=pflash,format=raw,file=ovmf-x86_64-vars.bin \
         -nographic
```

Note that:
* EFI devices are included in the command. There is a code device for the EFI firmware and a local copy of the EFI variable store to persist any new EFI entry included during the installation.

## Upgrading the OS of a Booted Image

Suppose the image that you created as part of the previous sections has been running for a while and now you want to upgrade its operating system to include the latest available package versions.

You can do this through the `elemental3ctl` command line tool, by executing the following command:

```shell
elemental3ctl upgrade --os-image registry.opensuse.org/devel/unifiedcore/tumbleweed/containers/uc-base-os-kernel-default:latest
```

After command completion, a new snapshot will be created:

```shell
localhost:~ # snapper list
 # | Type   | Pre # | Date                     | User | Used Space | Cleanup | Description                             | Userdata
---+--------+-------+--------------------------+------+------------+---------+-----------------------------------------+---------
0  | single |       |                          | root |            |         | current                                 |
1- | single |       | Wed Jul 16 12:57:23 2025 | root |  12.28 MiB |         | first root filesystem, snapshot 1       |
2+ | single |       | Wed Jul 16 13:00:13 2025 | root |  12.28 MiB | number  | snapshot created from parent snapshot 1 |
```

What's left is to reboot the OS and select the latest snapshot from the grub menu. After the reboot, your snapshots should look similar to this:

```shell
localhost:~ # snapper list
 # | Type   | Pre # | Date                     | User | Used Space | Cleanup | Description                             | Userdata
---+--------+-------+--------------------------+------+------------+---------+-----------------------------------------+---------
0  | single |       |                          | root |            |         | current                                 |
1  | single |       | Wed Jul 16 12:57:23 2025 | root |  12.28 MiB |         | first root filesystem, snapshot 1       |
2* | single |       | Wed Jul 16 13:00:13 2025 | root |  12.28 MiB | number  | snapshot created from parent snapshot 1 |
```

The latest snapshot will be running on the latest version of the `registry.opensuse.org/devel/unifiedcore/tumbleweed/containers/uc-base-os-kernel-default` image and will still hold any previously defined configurations and/or extensions.
